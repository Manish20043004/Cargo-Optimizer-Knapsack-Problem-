# Cargo-Optimizer-Knapsack-Problem
In the contemporary era of globalization, the demand for efficient cargo transport has significantly increased, putting immense pressure on airlines and logistics companies to maximize the use of limited space while minimizing operational costs. 
The Knapsack Problem, a well-established combinatorial optimization problem in computer science and operations research, provides a potent framework for addressing these challenges in cargo optimization. This paper explores the practical application of the Knapsack Problem in optimizing cargo loading for airlines and logistic companies, where decisions must be made about how to best utilize finite space and weight capacities to carry the most valuable or important goods. 
The Knapsack Problem models the trade - off between the weight and value of items to be loaded, and in the context of cargo logistics, it helps determine the optimal subset of packages that can be transported in a single trip given constraints such as aircraft or vehicle weight limits, volume capacity, and priority of goods. 
This study evaluates both the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, where each item can either be included or excluded, and the Fractional Knapsack Problem, which allows for partial inclusion of items, depending on the application scenario. 
It also explores variations like the Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP) and Multi-Knapsack Problems (MKP), which more accurately reflect real-world constraints such as multiple cargo holds or multiple aircrafts/vehicles. 
Through algorithmic simulations and case studies, we demonstrate how dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and heuristic-based approaches like genetic algorithms and simulated annealing can be employed for scalable and near-optimal solutions in large and complex cargo environments. 
Real-world logistics data are used to simulate different loading scenarios, showcasing how such optimization not only improves space and weight utilization but also reduces fuel consumption and transportation time, directly impacting profitability and sustainability.
